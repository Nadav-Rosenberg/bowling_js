Bowling Game Scoring - JAVA

After making a Ruby Bowling Game Scoring Application, I will write the same programe in JS, using Jasmine as a testing tool. 

As a bonus, I will work on:
- web interface
- basinc styling 
- Heroku deployment

Setting a JS project: 
- copyoing Jasmine and SpecRunner
--> cp -r ~/Downloads/jasmine-standalone-2.0.2/lib .
--> cp -r ~/Downloads/jasmine-standalone-2.0.2/SpecRunner.html .
- adding spec and src directories
- writing the first test
